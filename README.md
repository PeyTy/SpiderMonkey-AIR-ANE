SpiderMonkey-AIR-ANE
====================

Javascript for Adobe AIR. Also, please **read this README**!

State: *Pre-alpha. Keep calm and wait for updates*
=====

This Open-Source project is funded by [Denis Novozhilov](https://github.com/gloomybrain) (more precisely, the company where he works).

The main idea of the project is to be able to perform identical **Haxe** (JavaScript) code on the client and server. It provides a fairly simple interface to the JS on the CQRS principle (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-query_separation)

Perhaps with the help of reflection its capabilities will be greatly enhanced.
Information is shared with the help of JSON objects.

There are plans to support platforms such as mac, windows, ios and android.

Download the **ane** file and take a look at the **demo** folder. It's very simple!
